`WoodWing Assets <https://www.woodwing.com/en/digital-asset-management-system>`_ is a **DAM (Digital Asset Management) system from WoodWing**.

This PHP client library uses its `REST API <https://helpcenter.woodwing.com/hc/en-us/sections/360008455892-APIs-REST>`_.
It is **not an official library** supplied by the vendor:
Instead, it has been developed for and by the German `SPIEGEL Gruppe <https://gruppe.spiegel.de>`_ during its Assets implementation.

The Assets Client is **open source and hosted on Github**: https://github.com/DerSpiegel/ww_assets_php_client
